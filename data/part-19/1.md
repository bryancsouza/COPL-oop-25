Haskell has a system called _algebraic datatypes_ for defining new types. This sounds fancy, but is rather simple. Let’s dive in by looking at the standard library definitions of some familiar types:

```haskell
data Bool = True | False
data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
```

With this syntax you too can define types:

```haskell
-- definition of a type with three values
data Color = Red | Green | Blue

-- a function that uses pattern matching on our new type
rgb :: Color -> [Double]
rgb Red = [1,0,0]
rgb Green = [0,1,0]
rgb Blue = [0,0,1]

Prelude> :t Red
Red :: Color
Prelude> :t [Red,Blue,Green]
[Red,Blue,Green] :: [Color]
Prelude> rgb Red
[1.0,0.0,0.0]
```

### Fields

Types like `Bool`, `Ordering` and `Color` that just list a bunch of constants are called _enumerations_ or _enums_ in Haskell and other languages. Enums are useful, but you need other types as well. Here we define a type for reports containing an id number, a title, and a body:

```haskell
data Report = ConstructReport Int String String
```

This is how you create a report:

```haskell
Prelude> :t ConstructReport 1 "Title" "This is the body."
ConstructReport 1 "Title" "This is the body." :: Report
```

You can access the fields with pattern matching:

```haskell
reportContents :: Report -> String
reportContents (ConstructReport id title contents) = contents
setReportContents :: String -> Report -> Report
setReportContents contents (ConstructReport id title _contents) = ConstructReport id title contents
```


### Constructors

The things on the right hand side of a `data` declaration are called _constructors_. `True`, `False`, `Red` and `ConstructReport` are all examples of constructors. A type can have multiple constructors, and a constructor can have zero or more fields.

Here is a datatype for a standard playing card. It has five constructors, of which `Joker` has zero fields and the others have one field.

```haskell
data Card = Joker | Heart Int | Club Int | Spade Int | Diamond Int
```

Constructors with fields have function type and can be used wherever functions can:

```haskell
Prelude> :t Heart
Heart :: Int -> Card
Prelude> :t Club
Club :: Int -> Card
Prelude> map Heart [1,2,3]
[Heart 1,Heart 2,Heart 3]
Prelude> (Heart . (\x -> x+1)) 3
Heart 4
```

### Sidenote: Deriving

By the way, there’s something missing from our `Card` type. Look at how it behaves compared to `Ordering` and `Bool`:

```haskell
Prelude> EQ
EQ
Prelude> True
True
Prelude> Joker
<interactive>:1:0:
    No instance for (Show Card)
        arising from a use of `print' at <interactive>:1:0-4
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show Card)
    In a stmt of a 'do' expression: print it
```


The problem is that Haskell does not know how to print the types we defined. As the error says, they are not part of the `Show` class. The easy solution is to just add a `deriving Show` after the type definition:

```haskell
data Card = Joker | Heart Int | Club Int | Spade Int | Diamond Int
    deriving Show

Prelude> Joker
Joker
```
The `deriving` syntax is a way to automatically make your class a member of certain basic type classes, most notably `Read`, `Show` and `Eq`. We’ll talk more about what this means later.

### Algebraic?

So why are these datatypes called algebraic? This is because, theoretically speaking, each datatype can be a _sum_ of constructors, and each constructor is a _product_ of fields. It makes sense to think of these as sums and products for many reasons, one being that we can count the possible values of each type this way:

```haskell
data Bool = True | False            -- corresponds to 1+1. Has 2 possible values.
data TwoBools = TwoBools Bool Bool  -- corresponds to Bool*Bool, i.e. 2*2. Has 4 possible values.
data Complex = Two Bool Bool | One Bool | None
                                    -- corresponds to Bool*Bool+Bool+1 = 2*2+2+1 = 7. Has 7 possible values.
```

There is a rich theory of algebraic datatypes. If you’re interested, you might find more info [here](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types) or [here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/papers/yorgey-thesis.pdf).
