Algebraic Datatypes: Summary
--------------------------------

*   Types are defined like this

```haskell
data TypeName = ConstructorName FieldType FieldType2 | AnotherConstructor FieldType3 | OneMoreCons
```

*   … or like this if we’re using type variables

```haskell
data TypeName variable = Cons1 variable Type1 | Cons2 Type2 variable
```
*   You can have one or more constructors
*   Each constructor can have zero or more fields
*   Constructors start with upper case, type variables with lower case
*   Values are handled with pattern matching:

```haskell
foo (ConstructorName a b) = a+b
foo (AnotherConstructor _) = 0
foo OneMoreCons = 7
```

*   Constructors are just functions:

```haskell
ConstructorName :: FieldType -> FieldType2 -> TypeName
Cons1 :: a -> Type1 -> TypeName a
```
*   You can also define datatypes using record syntax:

```haskell
data TypeName = Constructor { field1 :: Field1Type, field2 :: Field2Type }
```
This gives you accessor functions like `field1 :: TypeName -> Field1Type` for free.

Sidenote: Other Ways of Defining Types
------------------------------------------

In addition to the `data` keyword, there are two additional ways of defining types in Haskell.

The `newtype` keyword works like `data`, but you can only have a single constructor with a single field. It’s sometimes wise to use `newtype` for performance resons, but we’ll get back to those in part 2.

The `type` keyword introduces a _type alias_. Type aliases don’t affect type checking, they just offer a shorthand for writing types. For example the familiar `String` type is an alias for `[Char]`:

```haskell
type String = [Char]
```

This means that whenever the compiler reads `String`, it just immediately replaces it with `[Char]`. Type aliases seem useful, but they can easily make reading type errors harder.

## Exercises from 5a:

<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 5a.10">

```Haskell
-- Ex 10: define a recursive datatype KeyVals for storing a set of
-- key-value pairs. There should be two constructors: Empty and Pair.
--
-- Empty represents an empty collection. It should have no fields.
--
-- Pair should have three fields, one for the key, one for the value,
-- and one for the rest of the collection (of type KeyVals)
--
-- The KeyVals datatype is parameterized by the key type k and
-- the value type v.
--
-- For example:
--
--  Pair "cat" True (Pair "dog" False Empty)  ::  KeyVals String Bool
--
-- Also define the functions toList and fromList that convert between
-- KeyVals and lists of pairs.

data KeyVals k v = KeyValsUndefined
  deriving Show

toList :: KeyVals k v -> [(k,v)]
toList = todo

fromList :: [(k,v)] -> KeyVals k v
fromList = todo
```

<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 5a.11">

```Haskell
-- Ex 11: The data type Nat is the so called Peano
-- representation for natural numbers. Define functions fromNat and
-- toNat that convert natural numbers to Ints and vice versa.
--
-- Examples:
--   fromNat (PlusOne (PlusOne (PlusOne Zero)))  ==>  3
--   toNat 3    ==> Just (PlusOne (PlusOne (PlusOne Zero)))
--   toNat (-3) ==> Nothing
--

data Nat = Zero | PlusOne Nat
  deriving (Show,Eq)

fromNat :: Nat -> Int
fromNat n = todo

toNat :: Int -> Maybe Nat
toNat z = todo
```
</text-box>

<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 5a.12">

```Haskell
-- Ex 12: While pleasingly simple in its definition, the Nat datatype is not
-- very efficient computationally. Instead of the unary Peano natural numbers,
-- computers use binary numbers.

-- Your task is to write functions prettyPrint, fromBin, and toBin that
-- convert Bin to human-readable string, Bin to Int, and Int to Bin
-- respectively. Check the original file for more explanation

data Bin = End | O Bin | I Bin
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- This function increments a binary number by one.
inc :: Bin -> Bin
inc End   = I End
inc (O b) = I b
inc (I b) = O (inc b)

prettyPrint :: Bin -> String
prettyPrint = todo

fromBin :: Bin -> Int
fromBin = todo

toBin :: Int -> Bin
toBin = todo
```
