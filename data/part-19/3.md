*   You know how to define a recursive data type
*   You know in particular how to use a tree in Haskell

</text-box>


So far, all of the types we’ve defined have been of constant size. We can represent one report or one colour, but how could we represent a collection of things? We could use lists of course, but could we define a list type ourselves?

Just like Haskell functions, Haskell data types can be _recursive_. This is no weirder than having an object in Java or Python that refers to another object of the same class. This is how you define a list of integers:

```haskell
data IntList = Empty | Node Int IntList
    deriving Show

ihead :: IntList -> Int
ihead (Node i _) = i

itail :: IntList -> IntList
itail (Node _ t) = t

ilength :: IntList -> Int
ilength Empty = 0
ilength (Node _ t) = 1 + ilength t
```

We can use the functions defined above to work with lists of integers:

```haskell
Prelude> ihead (Node 3 (Node 5 (Node 4 Empty)))
3
Prelude> itail (Node 3 (Node 5 (Node 4 Empty)))
Node 5 (Node 4 Empty)
Prelude> ilength (Node 3 (Node 5 (Node 4 Empty)))
3
```
Note that we can’t put values other than `Int`s inside our `IntList`:

```
Prelude> Node False Empty

<interactive>:3:6: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
    • In the first argument of ‘Node’, namely ‘False’
        In the expression: Node False Empty
        In an equation for ‘it’: it = Node False Empty
```

To be able to put any type of element in our list, let’s do the same thing with a type parameter. This is the same as the built in type `[a]`, but with slightly clunkier syntax:

```
data List a = Empty | Node a (List a)
    deriving Show
```

Note how we need to pass the the type parameter `a` onwards in the recursion. We need to write `Node a (List a)` instead of `Node a List`. The `Node` constructor has two arguments. The first has type `a`, and the second has type `List a`. Here are the reimplementations of some standard list functions for our `List` type:

```haskell
lhead :: List a -> a
lhead (Node h _) = h

ltail :: List a -> List a
ltail (Node _ t) = t

lnull :: List a -> Bool
lnull Empty = True
lnull _     = False

llength :: List a -> Int
llength Empty = 0
llength (Node _ t) = 1 + llength t

Prelude> lhead (Node True Empty)
True
Prelude> ltail (Node True (Node False Empty))
Node False Empty
Prelude> lnull Empty
True
```

Note that just like with normal Haskell lists, we can’t have elements of different types in the same list:

```haskell
Prelude> Node True (Node "foo" Empty)

<interactive>:5:12: error:
    • Couldn't match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Bool’
        Expected type: List Bool
        Actual type: List [Char]
    • In the second argument of ‘Node’, namely ‘(Node "foo" Empty)’
        In the expression: Node True (Node "foo" Empty)
        In an equation for ‘it’: it = Node True (Node "foo" Empty)
```

### Example: Growing a Tree

Just like a list, we can also represent a binary tree:
```haskell
data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) | Empty
```
Our tree contains nodes, which contain a value of type `a` and two child trees, and empty trees.

In case you’re not familiar with binary trees, they’re a data structure that’s often used as the basis for other data structures (`Data.Map` is based on trees!). Binary trees are often drawn as (upside-down) pictures, like this:

![](binaryTree.svg)

The highest node in the tree is called the _root_ (`0` in this case), and the nodes with no children are called `leaves` (`2`, `3` and `4` in this case). We can define this tree using our `Tree` type like this:

```haskell
example :: Tree Int
example = (Node 0 (Node 1 (Node 2 Empty Empty)
                            (Node 3 Empty Empty))
                    (Node 4 Empty Empty))
```
The height of a binary tree is length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. In Haskell terms, it’s how many nested levels of `Node` constructors you need to build the tree. The height of our example tree is 3. Here’s a function that computes the height of a tree:

```haskell
treeHeight :: Tree a -> Int
treeHeight Empty = 0
treeHeight (Node _ l r) = 1 + max (treeHeight l) (treeHeight r)

treeHeight Empty ==> 0
treeHeight (Node 2 Empty Empty)
    ==> 1 + max (treeHeight Empty) (treeHeight Empty)
    ==> 1 + max 0 0
    ==> 1
treeHeight (Node 1 Empty (Node 2 Empty Empty))
    ==> 1 + max (treeHeight Empty) (treeHeight (Node 2 Empty Empty))
    ==> 1 + max 0 1
    ==> 2
treeHeight (Node 0 (Node 1 Empty (Node 2 Empty Empty)) Empty)
    ==> 1 + max (treeHeight (Node 1 Empty (Node 2 Empty Empty))) (treeHeight Empty)
    ==> 1 + max 2 0
    ==> 3
```

In case you’re familiar with _binary search trees_, here are the definitions of the lookup and insert opertions for a binary search tree. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you don’t need to understand this.

```haskell
lookup :: Int -> Tree Int -> Bool
lookup x Empty = False
lookup x (Node y l r)
    | x < y = lookup x l
    | x > y = lookup x r
    | otherwise = True

insert :: Int -> Tree Int -> Tree Int
insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
insert x (Node y l r)
    | x < y = Node y (insert x l) r
    | x > y = Node y l (insert x r)
    | otherwise = Node y l r
```
