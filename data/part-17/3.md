The last spanner we need in our functional programming toolbox is λ (lambda). Lambda expressions are _anonymous functions_. Consider a situation where you need a function only once, for example in an expression like

```haskell
let big x = x>7 in filter big [1,10,100]
```

A lambda expression allows us to write this directly, without defining a name (`big`) for the helper function:

```haskell
filter (\x -> x>7) [1,10,100]
```

Here are some more examples in GHCi:

```haskell
Prelude> (\x -> x*x) 3
9
Prelude> (\x -> reverse x == x) "ABBA"
True
Prelude> filter (\x -> reverse x == x) ["ABBA","ACDC","otto","lothar","anna"]
["ABBA","otto","anna"]
Prelude> (\x y -> x^2+y^2) 2 3           -- multiple arguments
13
```

The Haskell syntax for lambdas is a bit surprising. The backslash character (`\`) stands for the greek letter lambda (λ). The Haskell expression `\x -> x+1` is trying to mimic the mathematical notation _λx. x+1_. Other languages use syntax like `x => x+1` (JavaScript) or `lambda x: x+1` (Python).

**Note!** You never _need_ to use a lambda expression. You can always instead define the function normally using `let` or `where`.

By the way, lambda expressions are quite powerful constructs which have a deep theory of their own, known as [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). Some even consider purely functional programming languages such as Haskell to be typed extensions of Lambda calculus with extra syntax.
