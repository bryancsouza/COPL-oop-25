This is the course material for the first part of **Concepts of Programming Languanges (SOW-BKI-137)** which is based on the course 'Advanced Course in Programming' from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

Through the OOP part of the course we will use some of the reading materials and the exercises of this course, startig from Part 8 of the original course. Every week you will find which exercises you need to do in the assignment provided in Brightspace.

<!-- To pass either of the two courses you are expected to complete programming exercises and take part in an exam. Please see the [Grading and exams](/COPL-oop-24/grading-and-exams) page for more details. -->
