After this section

- You know how to make a definition in Haskell
- You know how to load a .hs file with GCHi
- You know how basic arithmethic works.
</text-box>

When you see an example definition like this

```haskell
polynomial :: Double -> Double
polynomial x = x^2 - x - 1
```
you should usually play around with it. Start by running it. There are a couple of ways to do this.

If a definition fits on one line, you can just define it in GHCi:
```haskell
Prelude> polynomial x = x^2 - x - 1
Prelude> polynomial 3.0
5.0
```

For a multi-line definition, you can either use `;` to separate lines, or use the special `:{ :}` syntax to paste a block of code into GHCi:

```haskell
Prelude> :{
Prelude| polynomial :: Double -> Double
Prelude| polynomial x = x^2 - x - 1
Prelude| :}
Prelude> polynomial 3.0
5.0
```
Finally, you can paste the code into a new or existing `.hs` file, and then `:load` it into GHCi. If the file has already been loaded, you can also use `:reload`.

```Haskell
-- first copy and paste the definition into Example.hs, then run GHCi
Prelude> :load Example.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Example.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main> polynomial 3.0
5.0
-- now you can edit the definition
*Main> :reload
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Example.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main> polynomial 3
3.0
```

After you’ve run the example, try modifying it, or making another function that is similar but different. You learn programming by programming, not by reading!

### Arithmetic

There’s one thing in Haskell arithmetic that often trips up beginners, and that’s division.

In Haskell there are two division functions, the `/` operator and the `div` function. The `div` function does integer division:
```Haskell
Prelude> 7 `div` 2
3
```
The `/` operator performs the usual division:
```Haskell
Prelude> 7.0 / 2.0
3.5
```
However, you can only use `div` on whole number types like `Int` and `Integer`, and you can only use `/` on decimal types like `Double`. Here’s an example of what happens if you try to mix them up:
```Haskell
halve :: Int -> Int
halve x = x / 2

error:
    • No instance for (Fractional Int) arising from a use of ‘/’
    • In the expression: x / 2
        In an equation for ‘halve’: halve x = x / 2
```

Just try to keep this in mind for now. We’ll get back to the difference between `/` and `div`, and what `Num` and `Fractional` mean when talking about type classes.
