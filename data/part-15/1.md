Haskell Mooc, part 1
====================

by Joel Kaasinen ([Nitor](https://nitor.com/en)) and John Lång (University of Helsinki)

Lecture 1: …And so It Begins
==============================

About the Course
--------------------

This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.

This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.

Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.

This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.

The course is split into 8 lectures. They are roughly the same size, but some lectures have more material than others. Each lecture set ends with 10-30 small programming exercises on the topics of the lecture.

Running Haskell
-------------------

The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the `stack` tool, see [https://haskellstack.org](https://haskellstack.org). The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.

By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, [read more here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why) or [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/). We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.

For now, after installing Stack, just run `stack ghci` to get an interactive Haskell environment.

**Note!** GHC 8.10.7 has a GHCi bug that makes editing lines impossible on ARM-based systems. As a workaround, use `TERM=dumb stack ghci`. More info [here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20022).


Working on the Exercises
---------------------

The course materials, including exercises, are available in a Git repository on GitHub at [https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc](https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc). If you’re not familiar with Git, see [GitHub’s instructions on cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Once you’ve cloned the `haskell-mooc` repository, go into the `exercises` directory. To download and build dependencies needed for running the exercise tests (such as the correct version of GHC and various libraries), run following command in your terminal:
```Bash
$ stack build
```
Do note that the dependencies are multiple gigabytes and it will take a while for the command to finish.

**Note!** Here are some fixes for common problems with `stack build`:

*   If you get an error like `While building package zlib-0.6.2.3`, you need to install the zlib library headers. The right command for Ubuntu is `sudo apt install zlib1g-dev`.
*   If you get an error like `Downloading lts-18.18 build plan ... RedownloadInvalidResponse`, your version of stack is too old. Run `stack upgrade` to get a newer one.

There are primarily two types of files in the `exercises` directory: exercise sets named `SetNX.hs` and accompanying test program for the exercises named `SetNXTest.hs`. Both are Haskell source files, but only the exercise file should to be edited when solving the exercises. Instructions to all individual exercises are embedded in the exercise file as comments.

You can find the first set of exercises here: [Set1](https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc/blob/master/exercises/Set1.hs)

Use the tests file to check your answers. For example when you have solved some of the exercises in `Set1.hs`, run the following command:
```Bash
$ stack runhaskell Set1Test.hs
```
The output of the tests looks something like this:
```Haskell
    ===== EXERCISE 1
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 2
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 3
    *** Failed! Falsified (after 2 tests and 1 shrink):
    quadruple 1
      Expected: 4
      Was: 2

    ----- Fail
    ===== EXERCISE 4
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 5
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 6
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 7
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 8
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 9
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 10
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 11
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 12
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 13
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 14
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 15
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 16
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 17
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 18
    +++++ Pass
    ===== EXERCISE 19
    +++++ Pass
    ===== TOTAL
    1101111111111111111
    18 / 19
```
In the example above, I’ve made a mistake in exercise 3.

To make debugging faster and more straightforward, I can load my exercise file in GHCi, which allows me to evaluate any top-level function manually. For instance I can verify the above mistake by:

```Haskell
$ stack ghci Set1.hs
GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
[1 of 2] Compiling Mooc.Todo        ( Mooc/Todo.hs, interpreted )
[2 of 2] Compiling Set1             ( Set1.hs, interpreted )
Ok, two modules loaded.
*Set1> quadruple 1
2
```



For your convenience, as an edit from the original material, we have put the exercises after when we think you should be able to make them.
After you have made all exercises in a set, for example `Set1.hs`, you can upload it in the corresponding assignment on Brightspace.
We run the same test as you have locally, so if you pass them locally, you already know that you have passed the assignment.

The handing in via Brightspace is mostly for administration.

You can make the exercises in any IDE you like. If you want to practice with working with the command line, try making all exercises with Vim or Nano. However, making them in VS Code or any other text editor is also fine.
