## A note on indendation

The previous examples have been fancily indented. In Haskell indentation matters, a bit like in Python. The complete set of rules for indentation is hard to describe, but you should get along fine with these rules of thumb:

1.  Things that are grouped together start from the same column
2.  If an expression (or equation) has to be split on to many lines, increase indentation

While you can get away with using tabs, it is highly recommended to use spaces for all indenting.

Some examples are in order.

These all are ok:
```Haskell
i x = let y = x+x+x+x+x+x in div y 5

-- let and in are grouped together, an expression is split
j x = let y = x+x+x
                +x+x+x
        in div y 5

-- the definitions of a and b are grouped together
k = a + b
    where a = 1
        b = 1

l = a + b
    where
    a = 1
    b = 1
```

These are not ok:

```Haskell
-- indentation not increased even though expression split on many lines
i x = let y = x+x+x+x+x+x
in div y 5

-- indentation not increased even though expression is split
j x = let y = x+x+x
        +x+x+x
        in div y 5

-- grouped things are not aligned
k = a + b
    where a = 1
        b = 1

-- grouped things are not aligned
l = a + b
    where
    a = 1
        b = 1

-- where is part of the equation, so indentation needs to increase
l = a + b
where
    a = 1
    b = 1
```
If you make a mistake with the indentation, you’ll typically get a parse error like this:

```Haskell
Indent.hs:2:1: error: parse error on input ‘where’
```
The error includes the line number, so just go over that line again. If you can’t seem to get indentation to work, try putting everything on just one long line at first.


## Quiz


At the end of each lecture you’ll find a quiz like this. The quizes aren’t graded, they’re just here to help you check you’ve understood the chapter. You can check your answer by clicking on an option. You’ll see a green background if you were right, a red one if you were wrong. Feel free to guess as many times as you want, just make sure you understand why the right option is right in the end.
