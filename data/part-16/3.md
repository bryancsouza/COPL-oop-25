A Word About Immutability
------------------------------------------------

Because Haskell is pure, it also means that functions can’t _mutate_ (change) their inputs. Mutation is a side effect, and Haskell functions are only allowed output via their return value. This means that Haskell list functions always return a new list. In practice:

```Haskell
Prelude> list = [1,2,3,4]
Prelude> reverse list
[4,3,2,1]
Prelude> list
[1,2,3,4]
Prelude> drop 2 list
[3,4]
Prelude> list
[1,2,3,4]
```

This might seem very inefficient but it turns out it can be both performant and quite useful. We’ll get back to how Haskell datastructures work in a later lecture.

A Word About Type Inference and Polymorphism
------------------------------------------------

So what does a type like `head :: [a] -> a` mean? It means given a list that contains elements of any type `a`, the return value will be of the same type `a`.

In this type, `a` is a _type variable_. Type variables are types that start with a small letter, e.g. `a`, `b`, `thisIsATypeVariable`. A type variable means a type that is not yet known, or in other words a type that could be anything. Type variables can turn into _concrete types_ (e.g. `Bool`) by the process of _type inference_ (also called _unification_).

Let’s have a look at some examples. If we apply `head` to a list of booleans, type inference will compare the type of head’s argument, `[a]`, with the type of the actual argument, `[Bool]` and deduce that `a` must be `Bool`. This means that the return type of `head` will in this case also be `Bool`.

```Haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head [True,False] :: Bool
```
The function `tail` takes a list, and returns a list of the same type. If we apply `tail` to a list of booleans, the return value will also be a list of booleans.

```haskell
tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail [True,False] :: [Bool]
```

If types don’t match, we get a type error. Consider the operator `++` which takes two lists of the same type, as we can see from its type `[a] -> [a] -> [a]`. If we try to apply `++` to a list of booleans and a list of characters we get an error. This is what happens in GHCi:

```haskell
Prelude> [True,False] ++ "Moi"

<interactive>:1:16:
    Couldn't match expected type `Bool' against inferred type `Char'
        Expected type: [Bool]
        Inferred type: [Char]
    In the second argument of `(++)', namely `"Moi"'
    In the expression: [True, False] ++ "Moi"
```

Type inference is really powerful. It uses the simple process of unification to get us types for practically any Haskell expression. Consider these two functions:

```haskell
f xs ys = [head xs, head ys]
g zs = f "Moi" zs
```


We can ask GHCi for their types, and we will see that type inference has figured out that the two arguments to `f` must have the same type, since their heads get put into the same list.

```haskell
Prelude> :t f
f :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
```
The function `g`, which fixed one of the arguments of `f` to a string (i.e. `[Char]`) gets a narrower type. Type inference has decided that the argument `zs` to `g` must also have type `[Char]`, since otherwise the type of `f` would not match the call to `f`.

```haskell
Prelude> :t g
g :: [Char] -> [Char]
```

### Sidenote: Some Terminology

In a type like `[Char]` we call `Char` a _type parameter_. A type like the list type that needs a type parameter is called a _parameterized type_.

The fact that a function like `head` can be used with many different types of arguments is called _polymorphism_. The `head` function is said to be _polymorphic_. There are many forms of polymorphism, and this Haskell form that uses type variables is called _parametric polymorphism_.

### Sidenote: Type Annotations

Since Haskell has type inference, you don’t need to give any type annotations. However even though type annotations aren’t required, there are multiple reasons to add them:

1.  They act as documentation
2.  They act as assertions that the compiler checks: help you spot mistakes
3.  You can use type annotations to give a function a narrower type than Haskell infers

A good rule of thumb is to give top-level definitions type annotations.
