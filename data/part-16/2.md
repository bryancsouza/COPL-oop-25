So far we’ve always worked with single values like number or booleans. Strings contain multiple characters, but still in some sense a string is just one piece of information. In order to be able to do actual programming, we need to handle variable numbers of items. For this we need _data structures_.

The basic datastructure in Haskell is the list. Lists are used to store multiple values of the same type (in other words, Haskell lists are homogeneous). This is what a list literal looks like:

```Haskell
[0,3,4,1+1]
```
A list type is written as `[Element]`, where `Element` is the type of the lists elements. Here are some more list expressions and their types:

```Haskell
[True,True,False] :: [Bool]
["Moi","Hei"] :: [String]
[] :: [a]                   -- more about this later
[[1,2],[3,4]] :: [[Int]]    -- a list of lists
[1..7] :: [Int]             -- range syntax, value [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```
Haskell lists are implemented as singly-linked lists. We’ll return to this later.

### List Operations

The Haskell standard library comes with lots of functions that operate on lists. Here are some of the most important ones, together with their types. We’ll get back to what `[a]` actually means in a second, but for now you can imagine it means “any list”.

```Haskell
head :: [a] -> a            -- returns the first element
last :: [a] -> a            -- returns the last element
tail :: [a] -> [a]          -- returns everything except the first element
init :: [a] -> [a]          -- returns everything except the last element
take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]   -- returns the n first elements
drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]   -- returns everything except the n first elements
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]   -- lists are catenated with the ++ operator
(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a     -- lists are indexed with the !! operator
reverse :: [a] -> [a]       -- reverse a list
null :: [a] -> Bool         -- is this list empty?
length :: [a] -> Int        -- the length of a list
```

Sidenote: the last two operations (`null` and `length`) actually have more generic types, but here I’m pretending that you can only use them on lists.

Lists can be compared with the familiar `==` operator.

Do you remember this from our first GHCi session?

```Haskell
Prelude> :t "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
```
This means that `String` is just an alias for `[Char]`, which means string is a list of characters. This means you can use all list operations on strings!

Some list operations come from the module `Data.List`. You can import a module in code or in GHCi with the `import Data.List` syntax. One example is the `sort` function which sorts a list:

```Haskell
Prelude> import Data.List
Prelude Data.List> sort [1,0,5,3]
[0,1,3,5]
```

Note how the set of imported modules shows up in the GHCi prompt.

### Examples

Here are some examples of working with lists. In this case, instead of showing you output from GHCi, I merely use `==>` to show what an expression evaluates to.

Indexing a list:

```Haskell
[7,10,4,5] !! 2
    ==> 4
```

Defining a function that discards the 3rd and 4th elements of a list using `take` and `drop`:

```haskell
f xs = take 2 xs ++ drop 4 xs

f [1,2,3,4,5,6]  ==>  [1,2,5,6]
f [1,2,3]        ==>  [1,2]
```

Rotating a list by taking the first element and moving it to the end:

```haskell
g xs = tail xs ++ [head xs]

g [1,2,3]      ==>  [2,3,1]
g (g [1,2,3])  ==>  [3,1,2]
```

Here’s an example of the range syntax:

```haskell
reverse [1..4] ==> [4,3,2,1]
```
