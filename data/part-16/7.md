Things you can use as patterns:

*   `Int` and `Integer` constants like `(-1)`, `0`, `1`, `2`, …
*   `Bool` values `True` and `False`
*   `Char` constants: `'a'`, `'b'`
*   `String` constants: `"abc"`, `""`
*   `Maybe` constructors: `Nothing`, `(Just x)`
*   `Either` constructors: `(Left x)`, `(Right y)`
*   The special `_` pattern which means “anything, I don’t care”
*   Combinations of these patterns, like for example `(Just 1)`
*   We’ll learn about other patterns, for example lists, in the next lectures.

Places where you can use patterns:

*   Defining a function with equations:

```haskell
f :: Bool -> Maybe Int -> Int
f False Nothing  = 1
f False _        = 2
f True  (Just i) = i
f True  Nothing  = 0
```
*   In the `case of` expression:

```haskell
case number of 0 -> "zero"
                1 -> "one"
                _ -> "not zero or one"
```
The only thing you really _need_ pattern matching for is _getting the value_ inside a `Just`, `Left` or `Right` constructor. Here are two more examples of this:

```haskell
-- getElement (Just i) gets the ith element (counting from zero) of a list, getElement Nothing gets the last element
getElement :: Maybe Int -> [a] -> a
getElement (Just i) xs = xs !! i
getElement Nothing xs = last xs

Prelude> getElement Nothing "hurray!"
'!'
Prelude> getElement (Just 3) [5,6,7,8,9]
8

direction :: Either Int Int -> String
direction (Left i) = "you should go left " ++ show i ++ " meters!"
direction (Right i) = "you should go right " ++ show i ++ " meters!"

Prelude> direction (Left 3)
"you should go left 3 meters!"
Prelude> direction (Right 5)
"you should go right 5 meters!"
```

Other uses (that we’ve seen so far!) of pattern matching can also be accomplished with the `==` operator. However, things like `x==Nothing` won’t work in all cases. We’ll find out why when we talk about type classes in lecture 4.

2.11 Quiz
---------

How many values does `f x = [x,x]` return?

1.  Zero
2.  One
3.  Two

Why does the expression `Nothing 1` cause a type error?

1.  Because `Nothing` takes no arguments
2.  Because `Nothing` returns nothing
3.  Because `Nothing` is a constructor

What is the type of the function `f x y = if x && y then Right x else Left "foo"`?

1.  `Bool -> Bool -> Either Bool String`
2.  `String -> String -> Either String String`
3.  `Bool -> Bool -> Either String Bool`

Which of the following functions could have the type `Bool -> Int -> [Bool]`

1.  `f x y = [0, y]`
2.  `f x y = [x, True]`
3.  `f x y = [y, True]`

What is the type of this function? `justBoth a b = [Just a, Just b]`

1.  `a -> b -> [Maybe a, Maybe b]`
2.  `a -> a -> [Just a]`
3.  `a -> b -> [Maybe a]`
4.  `a -> a -> [Maybe a]`
