In addition to the list type, Haskell has other parameterized types too. Let’s look at a very common and useful one: the `Maybe` type.

Sometimes an operation doesn’t have a valid return value (E.g. division by zero.). We have a couple of options in this situation. We can use an error value, like `-1`. This is a bit ugly, not always possible. We can throw an exception. This is impure. In some other languages we would return a special null value that exists in (almost) all types. However Haskell does not have a null.

The solution Haskell offers us instead is to change our return type to a `Maybe` type. This is pure, safe and neat. The type `Maybe a` has two _constructors_: `Nothing` and `Just`. `Nothing` is just a constant, but `Just` takes a parameter. More concretely:

|Type|Values|
|------|------|
|`Maybe Bool`|`Nothing`, `Just False`, `Just True`|
|`Maybe Int`|`Nothing`, `Just 0`, `Just 1`, …|
|`Maybe [Int]`|`Nothing`, `Just []`, `Just [1,1337]`, …|

You can think of `Maybe a` as being a bit like `[a]` except there can only be 0 or 1 elements, not more. Alternatively, you can think of `Maybe a` introducing a null value to the type `a`. If you’re familiar with Java, `Maybe Integer` is the Haskell equivalent of Java’s `Optional<Integer>`.

You can create `Maybe` values by either specifying `Nothing` or `Just someOtherValue`:

```haskell
Prelude> :t Nothing
Nothing :: Maybe a
Prelude> Just "a camel"
Just "a camel"
Prelude> :t Just "a camel"
Just "a camel" :: Maybe [Char]   -- the same as Maybe String
Prelude> Just True
Just True
Prelude> :t Just True
Just True :: Maybe Bool

-- given a password, return (Just username) if login succeeds, Nothing otherwise
login :: String -> Maybe String
login "f4bulous!" = Just "unicorn73"
login "swordfish" = Just "megahacker"
login _           = Nothing
```

You use a `Maybe` value by pattern matching on it. Usually you define patterns for the `Nothing` and `Just something` cases. Some examples:
```haskell
-- Multiply an Int with a Maybe Int. Nothing is treated as no multiplication at all.
perhapsMultiply :: Int -> Maybe Int -> Int
perhapsMultiply i Nothing = i
perhapsMultiply i (Just j) = i*j   -- Note how j denotes the value inside the Just

Prelude> perhapsMultiply 3 Nothing
3
Prelude> perhapsMultiply 3 (Just 2)
6

intOrZero :: Maybe Int -> Int
intOrZero Nothing = 0
intOrZero (Just i) = i

safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead xs = if null xs then Nothing else Just (head xs)

headOrZero :: [Int] -> Int
headOrZero xs = intOrZero (safeHead xs)

headOrZero []  ==> intOrZero (safeHead [])  ==> intOrZero Nothing  ==> 0
headOrZero [1] ==> intOrZero (safeHead [1]) ==> intOrZero (Just 1) ==> 1
```

Sidenote: Constructors
--------------------------

As you can see above, we can pattern match on the constructors of `Maybe`: `Just` and `Nothing`. We’ll get back to what constructors mean later. For now it’s enough to note that constructors are special values that start with a capital letter that you can pattern match on.

Other constructors that we’ve already seen include the constructors of `Bool` – `True` and `False`. We’ll introduce the constructors of the list type on the next lecture.

Constructors can be used just like Haskell values. Constructors that take no arguments like `Nothing`, and `False` are just constants. Constructors like `Just` that take an argument behave like functions. They even have function types!

```haskell
Prelude> :t Just
Just :: a -> Maybe a
```

### Exercises from 2a:


<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 2a.7">

```Haskell
-- Ex 7: implement safe integer division, that is, a function that
-- returns a Just result normally, but Nothing if the divisor is zero.
--
-- Remember that integer division can be done with the div function.
--
-- Examples:
--   safeDiv 4 2  ==> Just 2
--   safeDiv 4 0  ==> Nothing

isPrime :: Integer -> Bool
isPrime = todo
```

<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 2a.8">

```Haskell
-- Ex 8: implement a function greet that greets a person given a first
-- name and possibly a last name. The last name is represented as a
-- Maybe String value.
--
-- Examples:
--   greet "John" Nothing         ==> "Hello, John!"
--   greet "John" (Just "Smith")  ==> "Hello, John Smith!"

greet :: String -> Maybe String -> String
greet first last = todo

```

<text-box variant='exercise' name="Exercise 2a.9">

```Haskell
-- Ex 9: safe list indexing. Define a function safeIndex so that
--   safeIndex xs i
-- gets the element at index i in the list xs. If i is not a valid
-- index, Nothing is returned.
--
-- Examples:
--   safeIndex [True] 1            ==> Nothing
--   safeIndex [10,20,30] 0        ==> Just 10
--   safeIndex [10,20,30] 2        ==> Just 30
--   safeIndex [10,20,30] 3        ==> Nothing
--   safeIndex ["a","b","c"] (-1)  ==> Nothing

safeIndex :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
safeIndex xs i = todo
