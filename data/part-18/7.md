Haskell libraries tend to have pretty good docs. We’ve linked to docs via Hackage ([https://hackage.haskell.org](https://hackage.haskell.org)) previously, but it’s important to know how to find the docs by yourself too. The tool for generating Haskell documentation is called _Haddock_ so sometimes Haskell docs are referred to as _haddocks_.

Hackage is the Haskell package repository (just like [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for Python, Maven Central for Java or [NPM](https://npmjs.com) for Javascript). In addition to the actual packages, it hosts documentation for them. Most of the modules that we use on this course are in the package called `base`. You can browse the docs for the base package at [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.4.0/](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.4.0/).

When you’re not quite sure where the function you’re looking for is, Hoogle ([https://hoogle.haskell.org/](https://hoogle.haskell.org/)) can help. Hoogle is a search engine for Haskell documentation. It is a great resource when you need to check what was the type of `foldr` or which packages contain a function named `reverse`.

Finally, since this course is using the `stack` tool, you can also browse the documentation for the libraries stack has installed for you with the commands

```bash
stack haddock --open
stack haddock --open <package>
```
This has the added benefit of getting exactly the right version of the documentation.

In summary, here are the main ways of reading Haskell library documentation:

*   If you know the name of the package you browse the docs via [https://hackage.haskell.org/](https://hackage.haskell.org/).
*   If you know the name of the function you can find it using [https://hoogle.haskell.org/](https://hoogle.haskell.org/).
*   If you’re using `stack` you can use `stack haddock --open` or `stack haddock --open <package>` to open docs in your browser.
