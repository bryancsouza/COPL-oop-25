Before we dive into type classes, let’s introduce the last remaining built-in datatype in Haskell: the tuple. _Tuples_ or _pairs_ (or triples, quadruples, etc) are a way of bundling a couple of values of different types together. You can think of tuples as fixed-length lists (just like Python’s tuples). Unlike lists, each element in the tuple can have a different type. The types of the elements are reflected in the type of the tuple. Here are some examples of tuple types and values:

Type

Example value

`(String,String)`

`("Hello","World!")`

`(Int,Bool)`

`(1,True)`

`(Int,Int,Int)`

`(4,0,3)`

To get values out of tuples, you can use the functions `fst` and `snd`:

```haskell
fst :: (a, b) -> a
snd :: (a, b) -> b
```
You can also pattern match on tuples. This is often the most convenient way, and also works for tuples of larger sizes. The `fst` and `snd` functions work only on pairs.

Tuples are very useful in combination with lists. Here are some examples using the `zip`, `unzip` and `partition` functions from the `Data.List` module.

```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]    -- two lists to list of pairs
unzip :: [(a, b)] -> ([a], [b])  -- list of pairs to pair of lists
partition :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])    -- elements that satisfy and don't satisfy a predicate

zip [1,2,3] [True,False,True]
    ==> [(1,True),(2,False),(3,True)]
unzip [("Fred",1), ("Jack",10), ("Helen",13)]
    ==> (["Fred","Jack","Helen"],[1,10,13])
partition (>0) [-1,1,-4,3,2,0]
    ==> ([1,3,2],[-1,-4,0])
```

Here’s an example of pattern matching on tuples:

```haskell
swap :: (a,b) -> (b,a)
swap (x,y) = (y,x)
```

Here’s an example of pattern matching on tuples and lists at the same time:

```haskell
-- sum all numbers that are paired with True
sumIf :: [(Bool,Int)] -> Int
sumIf [] = 0
sumIf ((True,x):xs) = x + sumIf xs
sumIf ((False,_):xs) = sumIf xs

sumIf [(True,1),(False,10),(True,100)]
    ==> 101
```
